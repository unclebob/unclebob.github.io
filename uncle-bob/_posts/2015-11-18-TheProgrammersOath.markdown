###**In order to defend and preserve the honor of the profession of computer programmers, **

##**I Promise that, to the best of my ability and judgement:**

1. I will not produce harmful code.

2. The code that I produce will always be my best work.  I will not knowingly release code that is defective either in behavior or structure.

3. I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.

4. I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.

5. I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve the code at every opportunity.  I will never make the code worse.  

6. I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible.  I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.

7. I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.

8. I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision.  I will not make promises without certainty.  

9. I will never stop learning and improving my craft.
